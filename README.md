## Roadmap

## Description
In a nutshell, we provide a collection of Javascript tools which allow technically motivated members of Toastmasters to examine statistics, 
trends, and other publicly available data in aggregate form. 

These tools have been developed by active members of Toastmasters as individuals - we do not mean to suggest that we represent the worldwide organization
or that Toastmasters International in any way endorses these tools. We do not provide anything that a motivated reader could not presently undertake themselves
by manually downloading speaking data in CSV format and using any basic spreadsheet program.

Additionally, these tools are client-side because that allows the worldwide organization to retain control of their data. If the existing Toastmasters data sites,
e.g. dashboards.toastmasters.org, reports.toastmasters.org, reports2.toastmasters.org, provided these features natively then there would be no reason for this
external toolkit.

These tools are provided without warranty and for personal/district use only. They are not intended for commercial profit. 

To be clear - if someone authorized from Toastmasters International writes us to ask to have these tools shut down, we will cheerfully do so.

## Licensing

These tools are provided under the GPLv3. If you're unclear what that means see https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3) .
